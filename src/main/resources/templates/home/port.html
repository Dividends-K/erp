                        <p>Originally, I graduated with two degrees in Media & Printing, and Accounting majors.
                            However, as if it was my calling, I was led into first contact with Programming in 2020.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the time, I was requested to create an effective voucher system to

                        <p id="about">Abiding by his demand, I devised a simple voucher scheme, which was the first step of my journey to programming.
                            At first, I created a complex MS Excel file to accommodate the scheme. It was met with slow speed and scalability
                            which required resetting to another file every 100 orders.

                            which was not exactly a programming language itself.
                            The application helped me effectively managed the sales
                            data and raised the firm's revenue by at least 15%.

                        <p>In 2022, I decided to migrate the back end of my application to MySQL, aiming to make my
                            application more portable, to a spare server machine: HPE Proliant DL60 Gen9.
                            However, the process of setting up ODBC on each machine that wanted access to the database was still somewhat underwhelming.
                        </p>
                        <p>In February 2023, with the familiarity to SQL and all those above, I decided to learn JAVA with the goal of making an ultra-portable
                            web application that could house my growing database. Besides, since my application had always been used for sales-monitoring,
                            upgrading it into a full inventory-monitoring application, or even an ERP, was a natural development.
                        </p>
                        <p>In September 2023, the application was partially done, reaching the functionality of the old MS Access one, though having
                            a much tighter control on inventory input and output.

                            My hobby is to read web novels on my kindle which does not have much support for web browsing.

                            In order to avoid manually copying the contents of free novels chapter-by-chapter,
                            I developed a piece of API using libraries of Jsoup and Apache POI that helps me parse the links and download the novel into a .docx file.
                            The formatting uses Bookerly font family, which was recommended from KindleAmazon for reading,
                            accompanied by proper indentation and chapter references.
